    MountainSort spike sorting (version 4)

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeseries : INPUT
        MxN raw timeseries array (M = #channels, N = #timepoints)
    geom : INPUT
        Optional geometry file (.csv format)
        
    firings_out : OUTPUT
        Firings array channels/times/labels (3xL, L = num. events)
        
    adjacency_radius : float
        Radius of local sorting neighborhood, corresponding to the geometry file (same units). 0 means each channel is sorted independently. -1 means all channels are included in every neighborhood.
    detect_sign : int
        Use 1, -1, or 0 to detect positive peaks, negative peaks, or both, respectively
    detect_threshold : float
        Threshold for event detection, corresponding to the input file. So if the input file is normalized to have noise standard deviation 1 (e.g., whitened), then this is in units of std. deviations away from the mean.
    detect_interval : int
        The minimum number of timepoints between adjacent spikes detected in the same channel neighborhood.
    clip_size : int
        Size of extracted clips or snippets, used throughout
    num_features : int
        Number of features to use when performing PCA
    max_num_clips_for_pca : int
        The max number of clips that will be subsampled for PCA.
    num_workers : int
        Number of simultaneous workers (or processes). The default is multiprocessing.cpu_count().
